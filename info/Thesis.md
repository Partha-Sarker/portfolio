# A Notification Based Nudge for Handling Excessive Smartphone Use
- Study and design of App Usage Monitor. Reduced over 6% smartphone usage.
- Conducted an online survey to learn smartphone usage behaviour among individuals.
- Designed a three week experiment for collecting smartphone usage data and validating the effectiveness of our application.

## Abstract
Excessive use of smartphones is a worldwide known issue. In
this study, we proposed a notification-based intervention approach to reduce smartphone overuse without making the user feel any annoyance or
irritation. We did a user study (n = 109) where we found that 19.3% of
the participants are unwilling to use any smartphone usage limiting application because a) they do not want their smartphone activities to get
restricted or b) those applications are annoying. Following that, we devised a hypothesis to minimize smartphone usage among undergraduates.
Finally, we designed a prototype for android named “App Usage Monitor” and conducted a 3-week long experiment through which we found
proof of concept for our hypothesis. In our prototype, we combined techniques such as nudge and visualization to increase self-awareness among
the user by leveraging notification.

## Conclusion
In this article, we conducted comprehensive research on how we can alleviate the
worldwide issue of excessive smartphone usage among undergraduate students.
Initially, we investigated the consequences of excessive smartphone use. After
that, we reviewed several previous works and conducted a user analysis. We
surveyed 109 undergraduate students to better understand their smartphone use
habits. Then, based on the literature review and user study, we hypothesized
the lack of self-awareness among the undergraduate students and proposed a
notification-based smartphone mitigation prototype “App Usage Monitor” to
minimize excessive smartphone usage among undergraduate students. To prove
our hypothesis and understand smartphone usage behavior, we conducted a 3-
week long experiment with 16 volunteers.
The result revealed that most of the participants’ opinion about their own
smartphone usage was wrong which verifies our hypothesis. The result of the
experiment also showed a significant decrease in smartphone usage among the
participants when the intervention was applied compared to their usual usage. So
we can say that making the user more self-aware reduces excessive smartphone
use.
Finally, we think subtle and familiar interventions can be used to create
powerful tools for mitigating various technology overuse. We hope to see more
works that try to achieve smartphone usage mitigation via unforced techniques.

## App Usage Monitor
# Introduction
App usage tracker is built for collecting data for our thesis. App usage tracker is a simple app that tracks the usage of all your apps within your smartphone. You can see your daily or weekly usage history for any of your installed apps(up to the past 30 days). You can set daily or weekly targets and choose to get notifications at multiple levels of usage for any app. You can also see your past target history(how much of the target you used).

## Notifications
-  Upon exceeding the specified target for an app.
-  Upon exceeding 90% of the specified target for an app
-  Upon exceeding 80% of the specified target for an app
-  Upon exceeding 70% of the specified target for an app
-  Upon exceeding 60% of the specified target for an app
-  Upon exceeding 50% of the specified target for an app

## Note
The app is still in its early stage and we will update the app once we get any bug with the fix. So please give us your feedback, your feedback will be greatly appreciated.
