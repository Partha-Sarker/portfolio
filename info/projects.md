## [dbTEvariants](https://genome-data.vercel.app/)
Transposable elements (TEs) are DNA sequences capable of moving from one genomic location to another, a phenomenon known as transposition. Approximately 45â€“50% of the human genome is composed of TEs. Although most human TEs have stabilized over millions of years and are no longer mobile, certain relatively recent TE families retain mobility, leading to genomic insertions or deletions and subsequent genomic variations. The biological significance of TEs spans multiple critical areas, including contributing to genomic diversity through mutations and genomic rearrangements, facilitating evolutionary processes by generating novel genetic combinations, exerting regulatory influences on gene expression, and impacting disease mechanisms via gene disruption. Given their broad relevance, a comprehensive database of non-reference polymorphic human TEs is an essential resource for researchers and the scientific community. To address this need, we developed dbTEvariants, a manually curated database representing the most comprehensive resource to date for non-reference polymorphic human transposable elements.

## [P2P Messaging app](https://github.com/Partha-Sarker/Peer-2-Peer-messaging-app)
Implemented java socket programming for chatting and sharing text files over the same network.
- *Android studio, Java*
### Introduction
P2P Messaging App is a PEER-to-PEER android app built with Android Studio. 2 devices sharing same Wi-Fi network can communicate with each other through this application via socket programming.

App Link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RLN6I5Nn_9h-AnjtWHgnHqvtfXlVqs40/view?usp=sharing

### Some basic features:
- Comfortable and familiar messenger like UI.
- Option to change background image.
- Textual file exchanging system.
- Speech to text.
- Dark mode.
- Notification tone and Wi-Fi toggling system.

### Instruction
First, we need both the device connected to the same wifi network. The app won't work with mobile data. After running the app the user will be provided with a text field to provide a port address. The user must give a valid port number and click on the "Start Server" button. It's recommended to start the server from both the device after launching the app. After starting the server from both ends, the users can move to the next part. Now a user can give the IP address of the counterpart device and the corresponding port number to which the counterpart device opened a socket earlier. And after giving the IP address and port number user can press connect button. THIS NEEDS TO BE DONE FROM BOTH THE DEVICES. And then after the connection is established, users can chat

## [Linear Equation Solver - Draw Petri Net](https://github.com/Partha-Sarker/Solve-Linear-Euations-and-Draw-Petri-Net-Using-Unity)

### Introduction
This is a project I did for a client as part of his thesis work. This project contains some serious stuff like Petri-net stochastic simulation! Though I didn't get most of the simulation things, I was able to deliver the right things according to the algorithm the client showed and finish the project.

### Description
This project has two separate modules inside it. One module can solve linear equations and the other draws and simulates Petri Net. You can solve linear equations having any number of variables. If the equations hold a unique solution, linear equation solver can calculate the answer. The linear equation solving part uses the Gaussian Elimination method for solving the equations. Additionally, you can also draw petri net having states, transitions and create edges between them.
